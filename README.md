# Game Backer
This is a python tool that lets you backup many games!

To run it simply download the newest release in releases (currently https://github.com/Joshi234/game-backer/releases/tag/v1.0.2-alpha)
and unzip it and run main.exe

It would be cool if you would add more games to the library so we can support more. To do this simply run add in the tool and add a game. use ~ for indicating a user directory. Example:~/AppData/Roaming/HelloGames/NMS . Then do a pull request where you simply upload the game_list.json that was created in the same dir as your file. If you arent so in the entire github thing you can also send it to me on discord: Joshi234#9828

The program itself is pretty self explaining
